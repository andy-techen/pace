# Pace
Amidst all the stress invoked by schoolwork, internship search, and just life in general, it has been difficult, if not overwhelming for me to keep pace with everything thatâ€™s going on. Therefore, I hope to build an application that not only helps me get things done one by one, but also gives me some time to catch my breath and put my thoughts in order. Pace serves both as a productivity tool and a meditation timer, helping me pace myself more effectively.
